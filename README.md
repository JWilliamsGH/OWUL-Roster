# OWUL-Roster
MVC and React

Instructions:

Setup the database:

Option A: 
There is a create and seed script located at \OWUL-Roster\OWULRosterServer\OWULRosterServer\Scripts\SQL
Open up SSMS 2016 and execute the script

Option B:
There is a database backup located at \OWUL-Roster\OWULRosterServer\OWULRosterServer\App_Data
Restore this backup to a DB named Roster


Run the code:

Open the 'OWULRosterServer.sln' solution at \OWUL-Roster\OWULRosterServer
If Views/Home/Index.cshtml is not the start page, set that as the start page.
Open the solution and start debugging by pressing F5.
This brings up the pure MVC site.
